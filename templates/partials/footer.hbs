{{!-- {{>footer}} is a syntax typically used in templating engines for web development, such as Handlebars or Mustache.
It is used to include the content of a separate template file into the current template. --}}


{{!-- Template engines are commonly used in Node.js web applications to generate dynamic content based on data from databases, user input, or other sources. They can be used to generate HTML pages, emails, reports, or any other type of text-based output.

Some popular template engines for Node.js include:

1---->Handlebars: A popular templating engine that uses a syntax similar to Mustache, but with additional features like helpers and partials.

2---->EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A simple templating engine that allows you to embed JavaScript code directly in your templates.

3---->Pug (formerly Jade): A powerful and concise templating engine that uses indentation instead of closing tags to define the structure of your templates.

Template engines can help you create dynamic, maintainable, and reusable code for your Node.js applications. They allow you to separate the presentation layer of your application from the logic layer, making it easier to modify and update your code over time.
